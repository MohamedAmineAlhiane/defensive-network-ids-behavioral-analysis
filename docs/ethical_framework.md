# Ethical Framework

This project is designed around defensive security principles and responsible
use of behavioral analysis techniques.

## Core Principles

- **Non-Intrusion**: No interception, injection, or manipulation of traffic.
- **No Targeting**: The system does not target individuals or real systems.
- **No Attribution**: Results do not label actors as malicious.
- **Transparency**: All logic is inspectable and explainable.

## Intended Use

- Education and training
- Demonstration of SOC-style reasoning
- Testing behavioral detection concepts on synthetic data

## Prohibited Use

This system must not be used for:

- Surveillance of individuals
- Monitoring without informed consent
- Automated punishment or blocking decisions

## Human-in-the-Loop

All outputs are meant to support human judgment, not replace it.
